  <h3>Erin Sturm</h3>
  <h4>President</h4>
  <p><p>My favorite thing to do is strategize! If you don't know where to start with your social media presence, I'd love to help you create a brand, a message, and a plan. If you know what you want to do, but don't have the time or energy to execute your plan, I can help you there too! I create original content and curate the best of what the internet has to offer.</p>
  <p>I love learning and am obsessed with sharing knowledge with others. Knowledge is power!</p>
  <p><span style="font-size:15px">Prior to beginning a freelance career, I spent six years working as an Information Specialist in a corporate library at a biotechnology company. I use the skills from my previous life to research my industry and my clients' industries. I also search for, and plan imaginary road trips to, restaurants that left town when I was a child - I miss you, Olga's Kitchen!</span></p>
  <p>I love reading and am always looking for book recommendations so tweet me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aperfectsturm2">@aperfectsturm2</a> if you have a suggestion! If you're interested in freelancing and motherhood, check out my blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freelancingmama.com">Freelancing Mama</a>.</p><p>My greatest joy is my daughter, but chocolate is a close second.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><h3 class="text-align-center"><span style="font-size:15px">Contact me at erinmsturm@gmail.com</span></h3></p>
