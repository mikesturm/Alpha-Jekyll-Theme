    <h3>Erin Sturm</h3>
    <h4>Founder, President</h4>
    <p>My favorite thing to do is strategize! If you don't know where to start with your social media presence, I'd love to help you create a brand, a message, and a plan. If you know what you want to do, but don't have the time or energy to execute your plan, I can help you there too! I create original content and curate the best of what the internet has to offer.</p>
    <p>I love learning and am obsessed with sharing knowledge with others. Knowledge is power!</p>
    <p>Prior to beginning a freelance career, I spent six years working as an Information Specialist in a corporate library at a biotechnology company. I use the skills from my previous life to research my industry and my clients' industries. I also search for, and plan imaginary road trips to, restaurants that left town when I was a child - I miss you, Olga's Kitchen!</p>
    <p>I love reading and am always looking for book recommendations so tweet me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aperfectsturm2">@aperfectsturm2</a> if you have a suggestion! If you're interested in freelancing and motherhood, check out my blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freelancingmama.com">Freelancing Mama</a>.</p><p>My greatest joy is my daughter, but chocolate is a close second.</p>

    <h3>Mike Sturm</h3>
    <h4>VP</h4>
				<p>My pedigree is what some may call academic&mdash;in that I received by B.A. and M.A. in philospohy, and taught the subject at the college level for several years. But I like to call my pedigree ideative&mdash;meaning that I came up in an environment where original and interesting ideas were highly valued. What I bring to the table is the ability to discover, develop, and communicate innovative ideas, and communicate them effectively&mdash;especially in written form.
				</p>
        <p>I have expertise in the written word, a talent for strategy, and a keen eye for design. This means that I excel at branding, social media marketing, content creation (though <a href="https://hackernoon.com/please-stop-calling-it-content-778bf3abfea3#.lr5pmrin7">I prefer to not to use that term</a>), and design. It means that whatever your brand is, I can help you make sure it realizes its full potential on the web.</p>
        <p>I write quite a bit on <a href="https://medium.com/@MikeSturm">Medium</a>, for various publications there. I am also on <a href="https://twitter.com/aperfectsturm">Twitter</a>.</p>
